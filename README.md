# KenPom-Dataset-23-24

If you arenâ€™t familiar with KenPom, it is a college basketball statistics website that ranks teams to show how strong they would be if they played at their current level, independent of injuries or emotional factors. The rankings update after every game, so you cannot go back on the website to a specific time in the season to see how a team was performing. This is why I scraped the front page of the website every week during the '23-'24 regular season.

Now, you can analyze how teams progressed throughout the season and see if any trends stood out. While I performed some of my own analysis, which I have attached as well, I would love to see what other people come up with and if it could be used to predict which teams will perform in March Madness.

The dataset is structured exactly how it is on the website, with the addition of a date column to know when each ranking was scraped. It consists of 22 columns and 7241 rows.
