# KenPom-Dataset-23-24

Over the course of the '23-'24 regular season, I scraped the front page of kenpom.com every week. This allows you to see how a team was performing at a particular point in time during the season and how they progressed. While I performed some of my own analysis, I would love to see what other people come up with and if it could be used to predict which teams will perform in March Madness.
